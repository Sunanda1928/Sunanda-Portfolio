# Sunanda-Portfolio
This repository contains my personal AI portfolio website, designed to present my professional journey, skills, projects, and achievements in a visually engaging and user-friendly format. The website highlights my interests in Python, AI/ML, content creation, and freelance work with organizations such as Outlier AI, RWS, and Gudsky Research Foundation. It features a modern hero section with animated particle effects, smooth scrolling, section fade-ins, and an interactive dark mode toggle to enhance user experience across devices. The portfolio includes structured sections such as About Me, Education, Skills, Experience, Projects, Certifications, and Contact, giving recruiters, collaborators, and peers a quick yet complete overview of my profile.

Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site is fully responsive, performance-optimized, and readable on both desktop and mobile screens. A skill progress animation visually represents my technical strengths, while the integrated contact form enables quick communication. The UI design prioritizes clarity, professionalism, and accessibility through thoughtful typography, spacing, and color contrast. The project requires no backend setup—simply clone, open, and run in any browser or deploy on hosting services like GitHub Pages.
